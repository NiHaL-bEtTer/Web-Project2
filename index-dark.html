                    <p><span>Treaty 1</span> was signed on August 3, 1871 between the Canadian government and the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) and the Swampy Cree first nations of southern Manitoba, this area covers present-day Winnipeg.
                        It is the first of the numbered treaties in Canada, so it's unique because it set the pattern for what future treaties would look like.
                        The treaty encompasses a huge portion of southern Manitoba.
                        The Treaty included promises of reserves, farming tools, and annual payments.
                        But the failure to fulfill many of those promises created problems for Indigenous communities.
                        The map shows Treaty 1 lands situated in the Red River Valley near the U.S. border.

                    <p>The original terms in <span>Treaty 1</span> included various promises that the Canadian government made to the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree nations.
                        A reserve of 160 acres was to be given to each family of five and proportionately smaller families. 
                        The government also promised farm implements, including plows and seeds, to assist families in growing crops, and annual payments of $3 per person.
                        The other pledges were for schools on reserves, fishing and hunting rights, and assistance with farming and building housing.
                        But, after the treaty had been signed, the government inserted secret clauses known as the “outside promises," which were never shared with the Indigenous leaders.
                        Such clauses diminished or eliminated certain benefits promised, such as agricultural tools

                    <p> After tensions with USA rose, The canadian government wanted to expand its teritory.
                        the government of Canada pressured the people living in the <span>Treaty 1</span> area to surrender land in southern Manitoba, to farm and settle.
                        That was part of a plan to spread Canada west and connect the country by rail.
                        They also wanted to prevent land disputes by entering into agreements with the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree nations.
                        But it did not fully respect Indigenous rights or keep many of its promises, damaging communities that had long lived on the land.

                    <p><span>Treaty 1</span> was with the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) and Swampy Cree nations, Indigenous peoples with deep relationships to the land in southern Manitoba.
                        Some of those communities include the Brokenhead Ojibway Nation, Sagkeeng First Nation and Long Plain First Nation. 
                        These countries made a deal to share their land for promises including reserves, farming implements and annual payments. 
                        But the treaty did not include the Métis people -- those of mixed Indigenous and European ancestry -- who also lived in the area.
                        The Métis also had their own distinct cultur and language, Michif, and were impacted by the land and resource changes as well.
